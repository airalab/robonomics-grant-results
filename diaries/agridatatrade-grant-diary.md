## Grant Diary no. 1

* **Date**: 01.10.2021

We have decided to order the following Hach sensor components as the initial set of 2. All amounts are in New Zealand Dollars (NZD):

TWO SENSORS:

* (Line 2 PN 2001H) Top casing: $4544 (HL4) - x2 (qty)
* (Line 5 PN 2001H) pH attachment with refill ($688) - x2 (qty)
* (Line 10 PN 2001H) Nitrate attachment ($827) - x2 (qty)
* (Line 14 PN 2001H) Conductivity attachment ($592) - x2 (qty)
* (Line 20 PN 2001H) 25M Deployment Cable ($799) - x2 (qty)
* (Line 21 PN 2001H) RS485 ($321) - x2 (qty)

CONSUMABLES:

* (Line 11 PN 2001H) 3-month supplies of pH pellets at $259 - x4 (qty)
* (Line 6 PN 2001H) pH ref solution ($15.70) - x1 (qty)
* (Line 7 PH 2001H) salt tablets ($15.70) - x1 (qty)
* (Line 9 PN 2947600) pH Solution Kit ($41.90) - x1 (qty)
* (Line12 PN 2001H) Low Range Nitrate Solution ($43) - x1 (qty)
* (Line13 PN 2001H) High Range Nitrate Solution ($43) - x1 (qty)

FREIGHT: $50

TOTAL: $16787.30 + GST

We have ordered these and are now waiting for the first two sensors to be delivered over the next month or two.

In the meantime, we have managed to get ESP32 board to connect to the Robonomics network as a node and we are designing a separate box that will house ESP32 with some 12v batteries to process the data coming from each Hach sensor and send it over CAT-M1 (https://www.spark.co.nz/shop/mobile/network/) network while being deployed in the field for several years. The sensor requires every 3 months "ph pellets" replacements as maintentance and every 9 months battery charging. Thus our box will be able to operate on its own for at least 3 months or more, using solar power and 12v batteries inside.
